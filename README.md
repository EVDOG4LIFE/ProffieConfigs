# Proffie Configuration Files Repository

This repository contains my personal configuration files for the ProffieOS used in ProffieBoard powered lightsabers. This is a new project for me so fonts and bladestyles are a WIP and will be fine tuned while I learn more about this hobby.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `/config`: Contains the primary configuration files for ProffieOS, and each .h file for my sabers


## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:** (You can even copy paste the config)

2. **Edit the files:** Modify the configuration files, blade styles, sound fonts, and color profiles as desired. I build my configs with the help of [Fett263's Proffieboard / ProffieOS Config Helper](https://www.fett263.com/fett263-os7-config-helper.html#fett263)

3. **Upload to your ProffieBoard:** Follow the instructions in the [ProffieOS user manual](https://fredrik.hubbe.net/lightsaber/v5/) to upload the configuration files to your ProffieBoard.

## Naming Conventions

I use a simple naming convention for all files in this repository:

- Config files are named after the saber and character they are inspired by, such as `kenobi.h`.
